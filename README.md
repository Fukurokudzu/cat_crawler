File index and catalogue for external disk drives

This is my first python project to try and test different approches

This is command line tool for windows.
It indexes selected drives, so you could search files and folders even when those drives are disconnected.
Might be useful, if you have lot's of removable disks to store data.

Those commands are available:

    print               print indexed volumes
    local               print local system drives
    scan                indexing files and folder for selected volume
    search              search string in file or folder names in database
    purge               remove database and index files
    remove              removes volume from index database
